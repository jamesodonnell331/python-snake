# Python Snake

This is a video game project aiming to develop a timeless classic game called "Snake".

## Development Process
This game was developed with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI o3-mini), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek (DeepThink (R1)) and Grok 3 AI. While the core implementation was generated with AI, I customised the game mechanics, created the art style of the game, modified the graphics, fixed bugs, provided audio samples for sound effects, provided and generated images, and provided the relevant input to prompt AI to generate the games code.

## Installation Instructions
To run the Snake game, follow these steps:

1. Install Python

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Download it from python.org.

2. Install Pygame

Install the Pygame library using pip:

    bash

    pip install pygame

3. Download the Game Files

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file:
